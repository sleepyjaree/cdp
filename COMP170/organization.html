<p>The course will cover the following topics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Variables and Types</li>
<li>Control Structures</li>
<li>Expressions and Evaluation</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Problem Solving</li>
<li>Object Oriented Program Structure</li>
<li>Console and Text Input and Output</li>
<li>Debugging, Testing, and Program Structure</li>
<li>Arrays, Data Organizations and Use</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>tentative</em> weekly schedule for the course is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Course Review; Required Preparation; Tools Introduction;  Java Intro, Hello World</li>
<li>Arithmetic; Variables; Into to Types: String Class; Precedence; Intro to Console I/O</li>
<li>Control Structures; Decision Making; Boolean Logic</li>

<li>Exam ONE; Introduction to Problem Solving: Pseudo Code; Playing Computer</li>
<li>Functions, formal parameters; argument value passing; return values</li>
<li>Break, time approximate, also for making up topics</li>
<li>Stepwise refinement; top down design; problem solving strategies; Assertions</li>
<li>Objects and Classes: attributes and methods, public and private, constructors, overloading</li>
<li>Arrays and data organization; their use in classes; Simple Text File I/O; Brief UML</li>
<li>How to Build a Custom App of Your Own; Problem Decomposition; More UML</li>
<li>Consulting on Project Work; OO Interfaces; Reenforce OO design and programming</li>
<li>Consulting on Project Work; More Class / Object Examples; Assertions and Testing</li>
</ol>
<p>The course is an introduction to  computer programming, covering basic concepts using a popular object-oriented (OO) programming language. Its structure is based around basic questions such as: what is an algorithm? How does one write, debug, run (“execute”), and test an effective computer program? How does one convert an algorithm into a computer program? How does one judge a program? What does “object-oriented” mean?</p>
<p>This  is a programming intensive course. Additional time and effort on reading, preparing, and programming will be required outside of class time.</p>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h3>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The textbook for this course is <em>Java, An Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming,</em> 8th edition, by Walter Savitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computer-equipment">
<h3>Computer Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#computer-equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> is a convenient tool, called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that combines text editing and the Java Virtual Machine. As the course progresses we will migrate to IntelliJ, a more sophisticated and comprehensive IDE.</p>

<div class="section" id="ground-rules">
<h2>Ground rules<a class="headerlink" href="#ground-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="be-proactive">
<h3>Be proactive<a class="headerlink" href="#be-proactive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses. And learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Seek tutoring to work over these questions. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis.</a></li>
<li>A grade of less than 50% in any assignment, is a warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with a tutor if the differences are not clear.</li>
<li>Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.</li>
<li>If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don’t need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-class-assessments">
<h3>In-class assessments<a class="headerlink" href="#in-class-assessments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessments instead of homework assignments. For in-class assessments, students will have 20-30 minutes to complete them at the end of class session. For consistency, <strong>in-class assignments will be held on the first day of the week the class meets.</strong> There will be about 8 in-class assignments. Students will not be penalized for missing up to 2 of these assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading-scheme">
<h3>Grading scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Course performance is determined using in-class assignments, weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure <strong>that students are learning.</strong> In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deadlines">
<h3>Deadlines<a class="headerlink" href="#deadlines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. Students are responsible for the timely return of homework and exam assignments. This responsibility requires students to notify the instructor in advance if they anticipate that they may not return an assignment by its stated deadline.</p>
<p><em>Bona fide</em> emergencies are, of course, exempt from this rule. Students dealing with an emergency should take care of it first and notify the instructor when time and obligations permit.</p>
<p>Homework, midterm, and final assignments are due one week after assigned. These assignments should be returned via Sakai.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>In-class assessments<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For in-class assessments, students will have 20-30 minutes to complete them at the end of class session. For consistency, <strong>in-class assessments will be held midweek,</strong> on Monday or Tuesday. There will be about 10 in-class assessments. Students will not be penalized for missing up to 3 of these assessments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exam-dates">
<h3>Exam dates<a class="headerlink" href="#exam-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The midterm exam will be  an in-class, open book, open notes, open web test. It will be conducted during class hours on Wednesday, February 26, 2020.</p>
<p>The final exam will be an in-class, open book, open notes, open web test. It will be conducted 9 AM - 11 AM on Friday, May 1, 2020.</p>

<h3>Student hours - Spring 2020<a class="headerlink" href="#student-hours-spring-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Effective 3/16/20 and in compliance with the university’s response for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,</strong> Student Hours will be held online only via Zoom and only <a class="reference external" href="https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min">by appointment</a>.</p>
<p>Valid from <strong>January 1</strong> through <strong>April 30,</strong> 2020, student hours (also known as “office hours”) are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Monday, Wednesday: 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM – online only;</li>
<li>Tuesday: 12 noon to 4 PM – online only;</li>
<li>Monday, Wednesday: 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM – online only;</li>
<li>Friday: 10:20 AM to 11:20 AM – online only.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is always better to go to the scheduling site above and make an appointment than emailing the instructor if he has time available for an appointment. The scheduling website shows all available times and allows you to make an appointment easily, quickly, and reliably.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h3>Academic integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. <em>Verbatim</em> use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university’s policies for academic integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="professionalism">
<h3>Professionalism<a class="headerlink" href="#professionalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In additional to the technical content of the course, there is a professional element to it. The professional element of the course is meant to cultivate your <strong>essential work skills</strong> (some call them “soft skills”). These skills are highly sought after by employers. Essential skills include communication skills, neatness, punctuality, dependability, ability to work in teams, problem solving skills, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of this course, professionalism and essential skills are as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be clear in your communications. When sending an email, make sure that it has an opening, an objective, and a closing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The opening is a greeting line. “Hey” is never an appropriate opening in professional communications.</li>
<li>The objective is the main part of your email. Be precise and concise. For example, instead of writing “may I ask a question”, just ask the question.</li>
<li>The closing is a statement as to what you would like the other party to do in response to your message.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be respectful of others’ time. Here’re two examples:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Come to meetings (class, student (aka office) hours, study groups, tutoring, etc) <strong>prepared.</strong> If the meeting is about reviewing your code, make sure that your laptop is sufficiently charged, the computer is turned on, and the code is already loaded into some editor before you even step into the meeting room. Do not spend 5 minutes in the meeting finding a power outlet, turning on and booting the computer, and firing up an editor.</li>
<li>When in group meeting (e.g., class, study group, etc) keep your questions relevant to the objective of the meeting.</li>
<li>When making an appointment and you realize that you cannot attend the meeting, notify the other party as soon as possible.</li>
<li>When discussing a problem, be prepared to offer suggestions for reasonable solutions.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be respectful of <strong>your own time.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Try emailing a question instead of waiting for Student (office) Hours. If the question is related to programming, attach a copy of your code. In most cases you will get an answer within a few hours.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be organized and neat.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>When turning in homework or other assignments, make sure that your writing is legible and the overall appearance reflects quality and care. Content is always the most critical aspect of your work; but appearance counts too.</li>
<li>When submitting code, make sure the files are properly named. For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">homework.java</span></code> may make sense on your side of the shop, but from the grader’s perspective it’s not very helpful. Instead, give your file a unique name that identifies it back to you, e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JaneDoe-homework-2.java</span></code>.</li>
<li>When submitting photos of your work, name the files accordingly. Instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IMG_123.JPG</span></code> it should be called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JohnDoe_problem1a.jpg</span></code> or something equally indicative of where the file is coming from and what it contains.</li>
<li>Follow instructions. Instructions and directions reflect expectations and requirements for your work. File naming conventions, deadlines, content style, etc, are important aspects of your work both in college and beyond.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zoom">
<h3>Zoom<a class="headerlink" href="#zoom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You need to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/zoom/">download and install Zoom</a> to your mobile device or laptop. Zoom is the University’s preferred tool for videoconferencing. In case of inclement weather or travel delays that prevent us from meeting on campus, we’ll use Zoom for an online class session. You can also use Zoom to meet with me during Student Hours, if one of us is not on campus.</p>

<div class="section" id="formal-notices">
<h2>Formal notices<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-notices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules">university’s official Academic Calendar</a>.</li>
<li>Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructor’s <em>written permission.</em></li>
<li><strong>Accommodation letters.</strong> Students with accommodation letters from the university’s SAC need to alert me as early as possible in the course. In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessment instead of homework assignments. Students work on these assessments, during class, for 15-25 minutes. If your accommodation letter entitles you to extended time for testing, I will be happy to make arrangements so that you can return the in-class assessment to me within 24 hours. Please notify me as soon as possible, if you would like extended time fo in-class assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Duty to report.</strong> Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.</li>
