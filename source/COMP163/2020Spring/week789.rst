Review of Weeks 4 and 5: Algorithms
===================================

In week 4 we finished reviewing logic, propositions, conditional propositions, and necessary and sufficient conditions. For a change of pace we moved to discussing algorithms. 

Reading material
----------------

* From the recommended textbook: Chapter 4.
