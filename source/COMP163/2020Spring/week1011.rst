**Problem 1**. There are :math:`6^3` possible outcomes when rolling three dice.

**Problem 2**. The most likely sum to roll two fair dice to is 7. Because this sum can be achieved by the largest possible combinations between the two dice, i.e., 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, and 6+1. (Grading notes: solutions that do not answer the "why" part of this problem, are incomplete).

**Problem 3**. The planes with heavy damage in the outer wings and the rear fuselage, made it safely to their base. It means that such heavy damage did not affect the plane's ability to fly. Therefore these areas are the least likely candidates for armor plating.

**Problem 1**. Assuming that the coins as properly glued, i.e., the head side of one coin is glued to the tail side of the other, the odds of tossing a head is the same as a single coin: 1/2. If the coins are glued tail-to-tail, the odds of tossing a head is 1. And if they are glued head-to-head, the odds are 0.

**Problem 2**. If the coins as properly glued, i.e., the head side of one coin is glued to the tail side of the other, the odds of tossing two heads back-to-back is the same as with a single coin: 1/4. If the coins are glued tail-to-tail, the odds of tossing back-to-back heads is 1. And if they are glued head-to-head, the odds are 0.

**Problem 3**. There are two correct answers to this problem, depending on how you interpret it: either 1/2 or 1/4.

Bayes Theorem Example
+++++++++++++++++++++

The standard expression of Bayes Theorem is:


.. math::

 P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}

A medical test that diagnoses a disease, is characterized by its *sensitivity* and its *specificity*. The sensitivity of the test is its true positive rate, i.e., the fraction of patients who have the disease and test positive for it. For example if 100 patients have the disease and 90% of them test positive, the test's sensitivity is 0.9. The test's specificity is the fraction of people without the disease, who test negative. For example, if 100 people are known to not have the disease, and 95 of them test negative to it, the test's specificity is 0.95.

Consider that a person undergoes a test with 0.90 sensitivity and 0.95 specificity, and tests positive for a disease that has a 13% rate in the population. What are the actual chances that the person has the disease? In other words what is the conditional probability:


.. math::

 P(\ \text{has disease}\ |\ \text{tests positive}\ )
 
For simplicity, we rewrite the conditional probability :math:`P(D|+)` where D stands for "has disease" and :math:`+` stands for "tests positive". 

According to Bayes theorem, the conditional probability above can be written as:


.. math::

 P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)}
 
In the expression above, :math:`P(+|D)` is the sensitivity of the test and :math:`P(D)` is the prevalence of the disease. We know these values to be 0.9 and 0.13 respectively, so

.. math::

 P(D|+) = \frac{(0.9)(0.13)}{P(+)} = \frac{(0.117)}{P(+)}

All we are missing is a value for :math:`P(+)`. This can be a bit tricky to obtain, but straight-forward once we realize with the quantity means. :math:`P(+)` is the probability that someone will test positive whether or not this person has the disease. This probability can be written as 

.. math::

 P(+) = P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|\overline{D})P(\overline{D})
 
where :math:`P(+|\overline{D})` is the probability to test positive if not having the disease. 
:math:`P(\overline{D})` is the probability to not have the disease and it is evaluated as :math:`1- P(D)`. Using the same law, we can also write :math:`P(+|\overline{D})=1-P(-|\overline{D})` where :math:`P(-|\overline{D})` is the probability of testing negagive if not having the disease; i.e. the test's specificity. Everything put together:

.. math::

 P(+) = (0.9)(0.13) + (1-0.95)(1-0.13) = 0.117 + 0.0435 = 0.1605

And so

.. math::

 P(D|+) = \frac{(0.9)(0.13)}{P(+)} = \frac{(0.117)}{0.1605} = 0.7289

In other words, someone who tests positive for a disease with a 13% prevalence, using a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity, has a 73% chance that actually has the disease.
