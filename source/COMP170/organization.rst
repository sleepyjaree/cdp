The course is an introduction to  computer programming, covering basic concepts using a popular object-oriented (OO) programming language. Its structure is based around basic questions such as: what is an algorithm? How does one write, debug, run (“execute”), and test an effective computer program? How does one convert an algorithm into a computer program? How does one judge a program? What does “object-oriented” mean?

This  is a programming intensive course. Additional time and effort on reading, preparing, and programming will be required outside of class time.


Textbook
++++++++
The textbook for this course is *Java, An Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming,* 8th edition, by Walter Savitch. 

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. `BlueJ <https://www.bluej.org/>`_ is a convenient tool, called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that combines text editing and the Java Virtual Machine. As the course progresses we will migrate to IntelliJ, a more sophisticated and comprehensive IDE.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using in-class assignments, weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.
