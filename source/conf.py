# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# allows sphinx to ignore errors in parsing ipynb files
# to be used with nbsphinx extenesion after it is added to 
# extensions above. Note that this extension will render
# every ipynb file it encounters, so I have removed it for
# now because it's not really very useful. All I wanted 
# was an equivalent to includeliteral for ipynb files.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
