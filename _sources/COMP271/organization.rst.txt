Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using in-class assignments or weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.
