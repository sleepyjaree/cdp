Deadlines
+++++++++

Late submissions will not be accepted. Students are responsible for the timely return of homework and exam assignments. This responsibility requires students to notify the instructor in advance if they anticipate that they may not return an assignment by its stated deadline. 

*Bona fide* emergencies are, of course, exempt from this rule. Students dealing with an emergency should take care of it first and notify the instructor when time and obligations permit.

Homework, midterm, and final assignments are due one week after assigned. These assignments should be returned via Sakai.
