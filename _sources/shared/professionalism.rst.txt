Professionalism
+++++++++++++++

In additional to the technical content of the course, there is a professional element to it. The professional element of the course is meant to cultivate your **essential work skills** (some call them "soft skills"). These skills are highly sought after by employers. Essential skills include communication skills, neatness, punctuality, dependability, ability to work in teams, problem solving skills, etc.

In the context of this course, professionalism and essential skills are as follows.

* Be clear in your communications. When sending an email, make sure that it has an opening, an objective, and a closing. 

 - The opening is a greeting line. "Hey" is never an appropriate opening in professional communications. 

 - The objective is the main part of your email. Be precise and concise. For example, instead of writing "may I ask a question", just ask the question.

 - The closing is a statement as to what you would like the other party to do in response to your message.

* Be respectful of others' time. Here're two examples:

 - Come to meetings (class, student (aka office) hours, study groups, tutoring, etc) **prepared.** If the meeting is about reviewing your code, make sure that your laptop is sufficiently charged, the computer is turned on, and the code is already loaded into some editor before you even step into the meeting room. Do not spend 5 minutes in the meeting finding a power outlet, turning on and booting the computer, and firing up an editor.
 
 - When in group meeting (e.g., class, study group, etc) keep your questions relevant to the objective of the meeting.

 - When making an appointment and you realize that you cannot attend the meeting, notify the other party as soon as possible.
 
 - When discussing a problem, be prepared to offer suggestions for reasonable solutions. 
 
 
* Be respectful of **your own time.**

 - Try emailing a question instead of waiting for Student (office) Hours. If the question is related to programming, attach a copy of your code. In most cases you will get an answer within a few hours.


* Be organized and neat.

 - When turning in homework or other assignments, make sure that your writing is legible and the overall appearance reflects quality and care. Content is always the most critical aspect of your work; but appearance counts too.
 
 - When submitting code, make sure the files are properly named. For example ``homework.java`` may make sense on your side of the shop, but from the grader's perspective it's not very helpful. Instead, give your file a unique name that identifies it back to you, e.g., ``JaneDoe-homework-2.java``. 
 
 - When submitting photos of your work, name the files accordingly. Instead of ``IMG_123.JPG`` it should be called ``JohnDoe_problem1a.jpg`` or something equally indicative of where the file is coming from and what it contains.
 
 - Follow instructions. Instructions and directions reflect expectations and requirements for your work. File naming conventions, deadlines, content style, etc, are important aspects of your work both in college and beyond.
