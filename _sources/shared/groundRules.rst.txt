Be proactive
++++++++++++
In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses. And learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college. 

Here's how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.

* Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Seek tutoring to work over these questions. `The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis. <https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/>`_

* A grade of less than 50% in any assignment, is a warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with a tutor if the differences are not clear.

* Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.

* If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don't need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.

In-class assessments
++++++++++++++++++++

In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessments instead of homework assignments. For in-class assessments, students will have 20-30 minutes to complete them at the end of class session. For consistency, **in-class assignments will be held on the first day of the week the class meets.** There will be about 8 in-class assignments. Students will not be penalized for missing up to 2 of these assignments.
