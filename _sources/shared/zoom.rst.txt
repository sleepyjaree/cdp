Zoom
++++

You need to `download and install Zoom <https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/zoom/>`_ to your mobile device or laptop. Zoom is the University's preferred tool for videoconferencing. In case of inclement weather or travel delays that prevent us from meeting on campus, we'll use Zoom for an online class session. You can also use Zoom to meet with me during Student Hours, if one of us is not on campus.
