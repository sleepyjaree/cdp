Leo Irakliotis' Course Documentation Project
============================================

This is a comprehensive site with material and information from the courses I teach. The documentation project is based on Restructured Text and `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. Files are committed to a Github repository with webhooks for `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/>`_, a continuous integration facility.
