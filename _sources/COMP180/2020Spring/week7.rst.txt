Review of Week 7: Intro to machine learning
=======================================================
 
Reading material
----------------

* `The SciKit Learn tools <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ are a collection of programs and utilities designed for predictive data analysis. The material on the website is a bit advanced and we'll use the judiciously and in context with the course's objective. Nonetheless, the site contains some good material, including a very useful `glossary of terms <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html>`_, and a thorough but dense `introduction to Naive Baye classifiers <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html>`_ which we'll use during week 7.

* Technical documentation for the `Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB>`_.

* The notebook with the `introductory implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier <https://github.com/lgreco/cdp/blob/master/source/COMP180/code/ML/introClassifier.ipynb>`_.
