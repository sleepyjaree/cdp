The course is an introduction to data science and visualization techniques, using Python. Students are expected to have a solid understanding of the basic properties of functions, with emphasis on polynomial functions, including linear and quadratic functions; Computing real and complex roots of polynomials; rational functions, absolute value functions, and inverse functions; and solutions of systems of equations. This is accomplished by having completed MATH 117 at LUC, or a similar course elsewhere.

As part of the course we'll cover matrix algebra, probabilities and statistics. Therefore, familiarity with the mathematical concepts in the paragraph above is essential. **There will be a series of in-class assignments the first week of the term, to assess that you have the prerequisite background to succeed in the course.**

This is an inherently programming-based course. We will use Python to conduct data analytics experiments and visualization. You don't have to know the language coming into the course, but you are expected to know *some* programming that will allow you to learn Python as you go along. 

Textbook
++++++++
There is no required textbook for this course. Reading material will be posted online as needed.

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will also need access to a computer (laptop or desktop) where you can install the Anaconda navigator. The computers in the classroom, as well as those in the *Information Commons* are equipped with a plain version of Anaconda that is sufficient for the early part of the course; however as the course progresses we'll need more advanced tools that are not available on the classroom's computers.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.33% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.
