Textbook
++++++++
There is no required textbook for this course. Reading material will be posted online as needed. It is recommended that you get an old copy (6th or 7th edition of Richard Johnsonbaugh's *Discrete Mathematics*).


Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using in-class assignments, weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.
