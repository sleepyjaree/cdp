Reading material
----------------



The *recommended* textbook for the course is *Discrete Mathematics* by Richard Johnsonbaugh. The book is currently in its 8th edition. If you want the book, I suggest that you buy a 6th or 7th edition; they are usually cheaper and just as good.

A number of alternative open educational resources (OER) are however available to support the course. These OERs include the following material.

* L. Lovasz and K. Vesztergombi's `lecture notes on Discrete Mathematics <https://github.com/lgreco/cdp/blob/master/source/COMP163/OER/LovaszVesztergombi.pdf>`_ (made available online by `L. Lovasz <http://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz>`_).
* O. Levin's `Discrete Mathematics <https://github.com/lgreco/cdp/blob/master/source/COMP163/OER/Levin.pdf>`_ (distributed under a CC BY SA license).
* J. Aspnes' `Notes on Discrete Mathematics <https://github.com/lgreco/cdp/blob/master/source/COMP163/OER/Aspnes.pdf>`_ (distributed under a CC BY SA license).
* J. Erickson's book on `Algoritnms <https://github.com/lgreco/cdp/blob/master/source/COMP163/OER/Erickson.pdf>`_ (distributed under a CC BY SA license).

In addition to the material above, this website comprises brief notes on key topics that are covered in COMP 163.
